## How to Set up Flutter SDK on Windows 

Disclaimer: It is expected that the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is downloaded on your device (after all, this is GitHub.
)
Download the Android SDK on your device at the [Flutter Documentation Site.](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/mobile#configure-a-text-editor-or-ide)

This can be found under the Download and Install switch on the main page. Click the button and let the zip file download.

Once done, extract the file and move it to wherever you want to, then go to your system environment variables, and add
a new path variable with the location of your extracted Flutter SDK folder.

## How to connect to VS Code

Once done installing the Flutter SDK, open VS Code.

In the top left toolbar, go to View > Open Command Palette, or access the search bar in the top middle and type '>'.

There, type flutter, and click on 'New Project.'

If you get an alert saying the SDK is not found, click 'Locate SDk' and find the path that contains your SDK file, and go to the point where you can see a 'bin' folder, but DO NOT GO ANY FARTHER. Skip this step if not applicable.

Now that you have accessed the SDK, click 'new application' in the command palette, name your project, and start developing!
